Oct 2022 changes:

-Fixed bug in Euler step scheme for PUIs (the PdivU  version of the pressure equation was not solved)
-Fixed bug in Level Set (Hancock solver)
-Modified DEFINE_REGION (new DEFINE_REGION_TRACER_4F allows to get both region 1 and 4 without using function REGTRACER_REINIT, which was overriding surface0. In doing so, the LevelSet compression (reinit) could not be used.)
-Added function tagCellsSpherical for simple refinement in the ISH
-Added PUIs for Cartesian grid
-Added tagCellsTailHP_Federico based on tagCellHPInstab, for long tail simulations. Used by default for Cartesian grid (tested on max_level=3 levels).
